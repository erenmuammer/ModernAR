# ModernAR <br>

ModernAR is a tool preform markerless tracking within Blender using Google's [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/). The main goal of the add-on is to efficiently transfer the generated detection results to rigs.<br>

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://cgtinker.github.io/BlendArMocap/).

### Features
- Detection of [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) detection results in stream or video
    - Calculation of rotations for mediapipe data
- Import of [Freemocap](https://freemocap.org) mediapipe session data
- Transfer tracking data to rigs and generate new transfer configurations
  - currently, officially supports the transfer to generated [rifigy rigs](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/rigging/rigify/index.html)


### Mediapipe Detection

Run Mediapipe within Blender to detect pose, hand, face or holistic features.
ModernAR calculates rotation data based on the detection results at runtime to drive rigs.<br>

**Caution:** Requires external dependencies which can be installed via the add-on preferences with elevated privileges.


### Freemocap import

[Freemocap](https://freemocap.org) session data can be saved in a `session folder` which then can be imported using ModernAR.
To import session data to blender, set the path to the session directory and press the import button.


### Transfer

Currently there's a preset configuration to transfer detection results to generated humanoid [rifigy rigs](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/rigging/rigify/index.html).
To transfer, just select the generated humaniod rig as transfer target and press the `Transfer` Button.
The transfer is based on mapping objects which you can modify. The modifications you can save as own configurations.<br>

You'll find the mapping objects in the collections generated while tracking such as `cgt_HANDS`.
Mapping instructions are stored as object properties and can be modified in the `object data properties` panel (where the constraints live).
Here the concept of mapping objects:

````
mapping_object: object with instructions and constraints
driver_object: generated driver based on instructions
target_object: copies values from driver_object via constraints
````

If you happen to create a configuration to support another rig, feel free to share it.<br>
